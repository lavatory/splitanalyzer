# PeimariSplitAnalyzer #

This is an example and test page for PeimariSplitAnalyzer aka "köyhän miehen winsplits". See project page for more details. Originally created for Peimarin Rastit when changing result system to EResults and at the same time making larger overall rework for Peimarin Rastit site. The site admin app was created on "community time" sponsored by Vaadin ltd.. This is pure GWT app that eats either IOF-XML files or jaxb xml files generated by "iofdomain" project.

The project can be built with GWT cross site compiler so it can be served from third party domain as well.

Note that the graph part uses [Highcharts library](http://highcharts.com/). If you use this software you need to comfort to their license. 

When starting developing (or building this project) download and add highcharts scripts to src/main/resources/org/peimari/splits/public/js directory. Then project should build with "mvn gwt:compile install" command, gwt debugger can be launched with "mvn gwt:debug".

Requires this project:
[https://github.com/mstahv/iofdomain](https://github.com/mstahv/iofdomain)

Known issue:
 * IE fails to parse IOF-XML files if they have iso-8859-1 encoding and host page has UTF-8.
